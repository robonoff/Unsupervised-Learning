# GUIDE THROUGH


In this repo, it's possible to find some of the Unsupervised Learning tecniques taught during the course of Unsupervised Learning '23, held by professor [Alexander Rodriguez Garcia](https://datascience.sissa.it/person/156/alex-rodriguez).

Python libraries have been used to perform the analysis, and they are the following: numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas. 



It's strongly advised to install all the python libraries in a virtual environment (these instructions are for macOS & Linux, but for Windows users is almost same). <br>
To do so, please follow these steps: 

1. Open the terminal, and navigate to the directory where you are actually working.
2. Create the virtual environment with this command:        python -m venv virtualenvironmentname
3. Activate the virtual environment:                        virtualenvironmentname/bin/activate
4. Install the packages:
``bash

pip install packagename


7. For deactivating the virtual environment:

```bash

deactivate

```


Whenever running the scripts, please keep in mind to have your virtual environment activated.
